**Program Design**

- We need to identify a cross-agency problem where there is already attention, energy and high-level executive support.
- Integrating this work into something that people are already responsible for.
  - People in multiple agencies because they are already responsible and reaching people that have a job to do
- It&#39;s a program that we are bringing to your work
- Complement leadership development program - grab people on their way up the managerial/leadership ladder
- How do we limit so people don&#39;t spend too much time in the upfront?
- Spend last few months on building out the solution
- Ambassadors would come along with teams and hopes to turn into ambassador&#39;s
- After 6 month engagement, there would be ambassadors that would follow-up with goals and ask how it&#39;s going
- Should we try to extend these opportunities not geo-located in DC area?
  - Most of the work is going to be in DC area for this first time
  - Benefit of external regions - is that agencies are co-located in the same building
  - How might we use existing courses like coursera that&#39;s distributed?
- This is our &quot;Strike team&quot;
- In addition to cross-agency teams, how might we create cross-functional teams (need HR, IT, Legal perspective)?
