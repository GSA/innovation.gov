## Workshop Notes

General comments

- Instead of current framing of solving problems, consider outcomes framing: what are the outcomes that government trying to achieve

- Get the government to articulate problems: what is the true problem to solve and what is causing the problem? Also, ensure that you&#39;re solving the right problem, and not just a symptom of the problem.

- Cost effective statement: how can we have the same cost but do it faster and have better outcomes
- It&#39;s hard to measure innovation: how do we measure our outcomes? In 5 years did we improve ability to solve problems?

### Activity 1: Barriers to Innovation

- Resistance to innovation on the Hill (Question: What is our evidence of Hill resistance to innovation - is it Hill resistance to government innovation specifically or innovation generally?)
- Different agencies different authorities (DoE)
- What is the proper policy? What is definitive?
- Clear guidance on compensation of users
- Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)
- Time restraints, expectations (ex: announceables)
- Not looking at issues holistically
- No standards provided across agencies
- Reacting to a problem
- Silo within organizations
- Agile personnel (Question: what is meant by agile personnel?)
- Lack of leadership support
- The need to infuse new technology with security and privacy
- Staff are measured with performance metrics that require meeting numbers and if they take time to learn HCD then they won't make their numbers. and that affects their performance, and therefore money in bonuses.
- For folks who have the ability to experiment, once you do and want to scale to a larger audience, one of the larger barriers is the lack of resources to carry that across; that could be human resources or something else; a lot of us seem to not have capacity to take on more work or a methodology to scale, because lack of resources &amp; with that comes often lack of necessary of air cover in leadership at the higher levels to push forth; some folks aren&#39;t willing to help you push it further out because it may require investment or heavy lifting and bias against innovation
- My staff and my agency are measured by the numbers they meet and make sure they get things done &amp; if they spend time learning, it will affect my numbers which ultimately affect bonuses. Solution: need to get metrics in innovation in supervisors and create performance standards around that
- Teammates reluctant to experiment with new tools
- Union rules say that some tools are not required (specifically talking about online  and PC-based tools and platforms, but also sure this applies to innovative concepts like Human-Centered Design (HCD) and others.)
- Partner agencies may not have access to our technology stack (or vice versa) so it makes it hard to collaborate and share files
- Staff says they don't have enough time
- Competitive & conflicting guidance; bureaucrats dodging bullets from compatriots
- Infrastructure is a major barrier.  We bring in designers who need Macs and Mac-based applications.  There is institutional skepticism of the need for these supplies, so we jump through major hoops to get them procured.
- People like HCD and also they find it useful.  I think that is the key selling point.  Unlike other methods, it's not a grind - people think it's fun!  Then they also gain the benefits of whatever topic they&#39;re exploring in HCD.  Yet, a major barrier is time. Doing a full-fledged HCD or innovation project can take time.  Leaders need to be persuaded that the benefits (and enhanced employee morale) of HCD/innovation outweigh any significant time commitment.

## Why

### Why is this important?

- Improve citizens lives
- Achieving agency outcomes (protect people, places, planet) (x2)
- The future
- Results for American people
- Because disruption is sometimes necessary to force a big change
- Increased public confidence (x2)
- Needed for success of all organizations
- Good public service
- Chunks the problem into manageable, testable activities
- Public trust
- Global competitiveness
- Global leadership (x2)
- People care about each other
- Improvements in service
- Crowd talent into public service
- Public trust (x2)
- Improved products and processes
- Innovation has many speeds
- Take advantage of new technology

### Why might this not be important?

- When individual leaders are pushing their own priorities or agendas
- Duplication of market/citizen efforts
- Overshooting government role in society
- When something is working really well, innovation may not be necessary. Important to know when to use it.
- If it's not implemented.
- Don't just follow the newest shiny thing
- Other priorities take precedence?
- Quality in the status quo
- Effort outweighs results (maybe)
- Keep what works….but important to have evidence!
- Government crowding out private investment
- Politics
- It becomes competitive/exclusive

### Why should we care?

- Justify funding
- Results
- Not an opt-out thing
- It&#39;s our job
- We pay taxes (x2)
- Funding at risk if seen as superfluous
- Government hates the way things are today
- Innovation can reduce duplication/outdated efforts
- Other governments **are** innovating
- Global competitiveness
- Future generations
- Russia
- Leads to organizational success
- Must keep moving forward with progress
- Attract better talent /coworkers
- It&#39;s our job to serve well (x2)
- Citizens
- Government impacts everyone
- Government NEEDS to be more effective--serves as a lifeline for many

### Why shouldn't we care?

- Takes forever to change everything
- Government hates change
- Can have unintended consequences
- Budget/effort needs to meet current needs rather than future initiatives that may fail or become irrelevant
- If new ideas don't have a problem to solve
- Need public support
- Private sector can do it!
- Need public support

### Why now?

- Make reduced budgets go further
- Opportunities to save $$ in an era of declining budgets
- Now will shape the future
- Innovation is happening now--everywhere
- Federal budget cuts
- Credibility of government and role of government is low
- So we don&#39;t miss critical opportunities
- Because people think we suck
- It's our job!
- If not us, then who?
- Uncertain resources in future
- Regain leadership role in world science and technology
- Infusion of young, motivated people
- Because it should have happened years ago
- Why not?
- Because we're already behind
- Good enough for government work needs to mean something (again)
- Do more with less
- Public pressure
- Already behind where we need to be

## Debrief after 5Ws exercise

- How can we get more agencies doing innovation
- Some people think innovation is either happening or not...sometimes innovation is slow going and quick.
- How do we build in moments to sit back and think
- Thinking about what would someone get out of the toolkit. Want people to engage differently, change processes. Innovation can be a little squishy
- Innovation isn&#39;t like: &quot;oh we have this new trick…&quot; It&#39;s helping people think freely of how we get to A → Z....no rigid thinking....

- What are some things that innovators can do to help you (lawyer) get to yes? We want to do this thing...help us figure out how to do this. There is resistance to create and be flexible...don&#39;t want the hill to think we are being cute.

- Due to a 50 percent budget cut innovation is a necessity.......
- Having trouble processing ideas...not a one size fits all approach...different agencies at a different place
- OMB runs two inter-agency groups on grant and evidence-based innovation/policy. Should plug into those communities
- We should rethink what a prototype might look like: should we focus it on a problem solving approach, and the big principles/mindsets of innovation for models/procurement/talents. How do you have a growth versus fixed mindset

## Activity 4: Better Government Culture

### Setting the Stage

#### Approaches to righting the internal plumbing or hacking red tape to lay a firm foundation for a better government.

- Mindsets
  - Evidence-based and behavioral insights (DOL ran randomly-controlled experiments)
- Each level faces differences (culture issues) and challenges
- Should look deeper at the [Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Innovation Group Report](https://www.oecd.org/governance/observatory-public-sector-innovation/home/)
- What is the maturity model for organizational innovation? Also list out the small stages of the innovation process--what are some examples for incremental change?
- USAID has a collaborative design workshop/space. It&#39;s a heavy lift for agencies, but what are the tips to build this out?
- Focus on bringing in talent, maybe challenging for many if not all agencies now
- Have renewed focus on unleashing the latent talent already in our federal workforce would be more viable in the short term
- Tell the story of ppl who have done amazing things
- Folks are generally hired for certain roles &amp; need approval to get out of their sandboxes; bias around ppl who work in procurement or IT &amp; may have a suggestion to finance in an area not in their space but don&#39;t have  right connection to get it; see silo across gov &amp; within an agency to get exposure &amp; try to contribute; could we create air cover for some of these folks to get involved? With all different things folks can do, as much as we share among ourselves, it doesn&#39;t always permeate down to rank &amp; file; would be really interesting for a bi-weekly report, similar to digital service listserv that goes out to each agency, someone who works in this role was able to contribute in x way &amp; may open up management&#39;s eyes to see ppl are succeeding and open up a way for more of that &amp; connect to other strategic initiatives &amp; federal workforce assessment; ways to connect things that would get ppl&#39;s attention- showing the value and doing the kinds of things; ways to further that
- Identifying internal champions; getting buy-in from your agency&#39;s legal department, human capital officer, finance officer, director, etc.
- Open Opportunities
  - Create an Open Opportunities Innovation space (a GSA-hosted detail/rotations tool) to connect Feds who need innovators with Feds who have innovation skills
  - Open Opportunities is across gov &amp; could be of use for some of the purposes of sharing successes; in the future adding that component
- Publishing/broadcasting &quot;warnings&quot; about upcoming changes and selling staff on the benefits those changes will have on their day-to-day
- Add specific measures for managers that describe in a more granular way what &quot;encouraging innovation&quot; means in their performance appraisals
- According to the 2017 Design-in-Tech Report, Deloitte acquired Uselab and Heat in 2016.   And in 2015 they acquired Mobiento.  In 2014 they acquired Banyan Ranch and Flow Interactive.
- Staff development/training programs
- Internal partnerships
- Setting priorities (especially in new Administration), Top Down
- What are the ways you will innovate?
- Full stack bureaucrat
- Innovation Capacity
- Risk taking (existing staff)
- Diversity
- Away from training → learning
- Internal talent has institutional knowledge
- Onboarding and integration (hiring of talent)
- Managing up
- Increased acceptance (grassroots innovation (to leadership))
- Capacity building
- Managing innovation capabilities (instead of hiring talent)
- Modes: Individual, Team, Agency/Department
- Know the constraints

### Things to Try

#### Programs or products that you can use at your agency to further a better government

- Communicate end results (Translation to an "innovation language")
- Mindset shift (Tell us what you need and want)
- Small increasing
- How can you do what you're doing with half the cost?
- Sustained engagements (long term)
- Collaborative design (design workshops) (done at USAID, Co-creation, power dynamics)
- Hackathons
- Learning agenda approach (questions and execute on questions)
- How to deal with overwhelming wicked problems (chunking problems, incremental changes)
- Micro innovations (quick wins) to slowly build up mindsets
- Unexpected or unlikely allies
- Show stories and data results

### Stories (Suggestion: call it results?)

#### Stories and case studies about people innovating within government, and incorporating outside partners

- People would allow users to connect with SMEs and experts working in innovation in order to get guidance/mentorship
- Anecdotes of people who have used innovation
- Focus on unleashing the latent talent already in our federal workforce would be more viable in the short term and one way to do that is to tell the story of ppl who have done amazing things
- Not often do you hear back on the outcome of those projects; would need to reach audience so ppl can see results and benefits of doing it, which would help a lot of people
- Is there a better way to help people tell their stories? What's a template?
